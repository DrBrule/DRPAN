# DRPAN: Discriminative Region Proposal Adversarial Network for High-Quality Image-to-Image Translation

## Introduction

The directory `DRPAN` is the preliminary version of our DRPAN work which has been published in ECCV 2018.

The directory `Pix2pixHD_DRPAN` is our extended work of combining pix2pixHD with DRPAN (Pix2pixHD+DRPAN).

The directory `CycleGAN_DRPAN` is our extended work of improving CycleGAN by DRPAN (CycleGAN+DRPAN).
